This SOURCE CODE LIMITED USE LICENSE AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is a 
contract between You and Intel Corporation and its affiliates ("Intel"). It 
governs Your use of the Materials. If You are accepting this Agreement on 
behalf of or in conjunction with Your work for Your employer, You represent 
and warrant that You have the authority to bind your employer to this 
Agreement. By downloading, installing, or using the Materials, You agree to 
these terms. If You do not agree, do not use the Materials and destroy all 
copies.   

1. DEFINITIONS

  1.1 "Including" means including but not limited to, whether or not capitalized.

  1.2 "Intel Components" means a hardware component or product designed, 
developed, sold, or distributed by Intel or its affiliates.

  1.3 "Materials" means software or other collateral Intel delivers to You under 
this Agreement.

  1.4 "You" or "Your" means you or you and your employer and its affiliates, 
whether or not capitalized.

2. LICENSES

  2.1 License. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Intel grants to You, for 
the Term, a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, 
revocable, limited license under Intel's intellectual property rights in the 
Materials, without the right to sublicense, to use the Materials solely for or in 
connection with your review and evaluation of the Materials (the "Purpose"). 
This includes the rights to make copies of the Materials and to generate 
binaries of the source code provided in the Materials as required to effectuate 
the Purpose.

  2.2 Restrictions. Except as authorized above, You will not: (a) use or modify 
the Materials in any other way; (b) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble 
the Materials provided in object form (except and only as specifically required 
under Section 2.5), or (c) use the Materials to violate or aid in the violation of 
any international human right. You will be liable for your subcontractor's acts 
or omissions. For the avoidance of doubt, Your license under Section 2.1 does 
not include the right to modify Materials delivered as source code and/or 
create derivative works.

  2.3 No Implied License. Except for the express license in Section 2.1, Intel 
does not grant any express or implied licenses to you under any legal theory. 
Intel does not license You to make, have made, use, sell, or import any Intel 
technology or third-party products, or perform any patented process, even if 
referenced in the Materials. Any other licenses from Intel require additional 
consideration. Nothing in this Agreement requires Intel to grant any additional 
license.

  2.4 Feedback. If you give Intel comments or suggestions related to the 
Materials or Intel Components, Intel can use them in any way and disclose 
them to anyone, without payment or other obligations to you.

  2.5 Open Source Licenses. The Materials may include software subject to an 
open source license, including licenses recognized by the Open Source Initiative 
(http://www.opensource.org). Nothing in this Agreement limits any rights 
under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable open source 
software license.

  2.6 Third-Party Software. Your use of any third-party software is subject to 
Your compliance with the license You obtain directly from that third-party. A 
listing of any such third-party software may be in a text file accompanying the 
Materials.

3. This Section 3 has been intentionally left blank.

4. OWNERSHIP

Ownership of the Materials and related intellectual property 
rights is unchanged. You must maintain all copyright or other proprietary 
notices in the Materials.

5. NO WARRANTY

THE MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR 
IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY KIND INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-
INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE MATERIALS MAY 
INCLUDE PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE OR ALGORITHMS AND MAY NOT BE FULLY FUNCTIONAL. 
INTEL IS NOT REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN, UPDATE, OR SUPPORT THE MATERIALS.

6. LIMIT ON LIABILITY

INTEL IS PROVIDING THE MATERIALS FOR FREE AND YOUR USE OF 
THEM IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. INTEL WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY 
FOR ANY LOSSES OR DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE MATERIALS, INCLUDING 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES WAS FORESEEABLE OR 
KNOWN. IF ANY LIABILITY IS FOUND, INTEL'S TOTAL, CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO YOU WILL 
NOT EXCEED $100.00 U.S. FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS 
AGREEMENT. THESE LIABILITY LIMITATIONS ARE A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF OUR BARGAIN 
AND INTEL WOULD NOT HAVE ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT THEM.

7. INDEMNITY

You will indemnify, defend, and hold Intel harmless from any 
allegation against Intel arising in connection with Your use of the Materials and 
You will pay all of Intel's losses, liabilities, and costs (including attorneys' fees) 
arising from the allegation.

8. PRIVACY; DATA COLLECTION

  8.1 Privacy. Intel respects Your privacy. For information about why and how 
Intel may collect and use information from Your use of the Materials, see

collection, license type, support type, installation status, hardware and

9. GENERAL

  9.1 Assignment. You may not assign Your rights or obligations under this 
Agreement without Intel's prior written consent. No third party will have any 
rights under this Agreement.

  9.2 Dispute Resolution. If we have a dispute regarding this Agreement neither 
of us can file a lawsuit or other regulatory proceeding unless the complaining 
party provides the other party a detailed notice of the dispute and our senior 
managers attempt to resolve the dispute. If we can't resolve the dispute in 30 
days, either of us may demand mediation and will then try to resolve the 
dispute with an impartial mediator. If we don't resolve the dispute within 60 
days after the mediation demand, either of us may begin litigation.

  9.3 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement is governed by USA and 
Delaware law without regard to conflict of laws principles. The United Nations 
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply. All 
disputes and actions arising out of or related to this Agreement are subject to 
the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Wilmington, 
Delaware and you consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

  9.4 Compliance with Laws. The Materials are subject to export controls under 
applicable government laws and regulations, including in the U.S. You must 
comply with applicable laws and regulations, including U.S. and worldwide 
export regulations. You must not export, import, or transfer the Materials to 
any prohibited or sanctioned country, person, or entity. You must not use the 
Materials for the development, design, manufacture, or production of nuclear, 
missile, chemical, or biological weapons.

  9.5 Severability. If a court holds a provision of this Agreement unenforceable, 
the court will modify that part to the minimum extent necessary to make that 
part enforceable or, if necessary, to sever that part. The rest of the provision 
remains fully 

  9.6 Waiver. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be valid unless 
in a writing signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party that 
specifies the waived provision. That signed waiver will not constitute a waiver 
of any other provision. A party's failure or delay in enforcing any provision will 
not operate as a waiver.

  9.7 Entire Agreement. Except for any non-disclosure agreement between you 
and Intel, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all 
prior agreements, between Intel and You concerning its subject matter.

10. TERM; TERMINATION; SURVIVAL

continues until terminated under Section 10.2.

  10.2 Termination. Either party may terminate this Agreement, with 30 days 
written notice, at any time for any reason. This Agreement will automatically 
terminate upon (a) Your breach of the Agreement, (b) an allegation that you do 
not have authority to bind your employer to these terms, or (c) Your assertion 
that an Intel Component, the Materials, or any product based on any Intel 
Components or the Materials infringes Your patents.

  10.3 Effect of Termination. Upon termination of the Agreement, the licenses 
to You will immediately terminate and You must cease using the Materials and 
destroy all copies in your possession and direct Your subcontractors to do the 
same.
